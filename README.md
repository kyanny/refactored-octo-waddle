# FizzBuzz Project

This project implements a FizzBuzz function and includes unit tests for it. It also provides a CI/CD configuration to run the unit tests and generate a coverage report.

## Project Structure

The project has the following files and directories:

- `fizzbuzz/__init__.py`: An empty file that marks the `fizzbuzz` directory as a Python package.

- `fizzbuzz/fizzbuzz.py`: Contains the implementation of the `fizzbuzz` function. This function takes an integer as input and returns a string based on the FizzBuzz rules.

- `tests/__init__.py`: An empty file that marks the `tests` directory as a Python package.

- `tests/test_fizzbuzz.py`: Contains the unit tests for the `fizzbuzz` function. It uses a testing framework like `unittest` or `pytest` to define test cases and assertions.

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: The configuration file for the CI/CD workflow. It specifies the steps to run the unit tests and generate a coverage report. It uses a CI/CD platform like GitHub Actions to automate the process.

- `.coveragerc`: The configuration file for the coverage report. It specifies the settings for the coverage analysis, such as which files to include or exclude from the report.

- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required for the project. It includes the packages needed for testing and generating the coverage report.

## FizzBuzz Function

The `fizzbuzz` function is implemented in the `fizzbuzz/fizzbuzz.py` file. It takes an integer as input and returns a string based on the following rules:

- If the number is divisible by 3, it returns "Fizz".
- If the number is divisible by 5, it returns "Buzz".
- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it returns "FizzBuzz".
- Otherwise, it returns the input number as a string.

## Unit Tests

The unit tests for the `fizzbuzz` function are implemented in the `tests/test_fizzbuzz.py` file. They use the `unittest` framework to define test cases and assertions. The tests cover different scenarios to ensure the correct behavior of the `fizzbuzz` function.

## CI/CD Configuration

The CI/CD configuration is defined in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file. It specifies the steps to run the unit tests and generate a coverage report using a CI/CD platform like GitHub Actions. The configuration ensures that the tests are executed automatically whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

## Coverage Report

The coverage report is generated based on the settings specified in the `.coveragerc` file. It includes information about the code coverage of the project, indicating which parts of the code are covered by the unit tests.

## Running the Unit Tests

To run the unit tests locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the project dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Navigate to the project root directory.
4. Run the command `python -m unittest discover tests` to execute the unit tests.

## Generating the Coverage Report

To generate the coverage report locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the project dependencies are installed (see previous section).
2. Navigate to the project root directory.
3. Run the command `coverage run -m unittest discover tests` to execute the unit tests and collect coverage data.
4. Run the command `coverage report` to display the coverage report in the console.
5. Optionally, run the command `coverage html` to generate an HTML report in the `htmlcov` directory.

That's it! You now have a FizzBuzz project with unit tests and a CI/CD configuration to run the tests and generate a coverage report. Happy coding!
